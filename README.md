# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [Astro](https://astro.build/) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://realworld-astro-qwik.vercel.app/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a frontend application built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/de/getting-started/) community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
